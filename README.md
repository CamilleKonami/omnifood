[Omnifood](https://camillekonami.github.io/omnifood/)
=======

### This is my first website made from scratch in order to use HTML, CSS and Jquery skills, as well as UI/UX design best practices.

It's a real-life website project: as if a company named "Omnifood", a delivery service of healthy meals, asked me to build their website.
This contains front end developement only.  

  There are 2 folders:
- __resources:__ contains all personal sources (what I wrote or what I was provided by the client)
- __vendors:__
contains all external sources collected as-is, on internet, for specific needs.
